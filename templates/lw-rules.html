		<li>There will be a number of simultaneous games (probably 4).</li>
		<li>Fixed start of all games.</li>
		<li>After a person/team declares victory on appropriate forum by listing the current turn and winning player(s), the remaining players have 7 turns to oppose this claim. RIP players cannot oppose. If you post accepting your defeat you are survivor, if you do not reply, you will be considered a RIP player.</li>
